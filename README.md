### Rules

1. Your solutions must be written up using this R Markdown (Rmd) file, this file must include your code and write up for each task.

2. This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people. You may use *any* online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly). You *may not* consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TAs for this course - this includes posting anything online.

3. You have until 11:59 pm on Monday, December 5th to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will not be accepted. Technical difficulties are not an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to commit / push.

4. All of your answers must include a brief description / writeup of your approach. This includes both annotating / commenting your code *and* a separate written descriptions of all code / implementations. I should be able to suppress *all* code output in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers.

5. You may use any packages you want other than the `darksky` package.

6. The most important goal is to write code that can accomplish the given tasks, note however that grading will be partially based on the quality of the code you write - elegant, efficient code will be rewarded and messy, slow code will be penalized.
